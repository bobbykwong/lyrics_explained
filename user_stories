<== Problem Statement ==>
While lyrics are readily available for people to search, it is difficult to find interpretations to these lyrics. It is also interesting to know the different interpretations people have of the same lyrics


<== Solution ==>
Web application where people are able to find lyrics to songs. Lyrics interpretations are also available. Users can add lyrics to songs and add interpretations to lyrics. Interpretations are arranged based on number of likes.

User Stories

1. As an avid music listener, the lyrics of the song is just as important as the song itself. But song lyrics may not be easily understood at first glance, it would be useful if I am able to find interpretations for the song lyrics. I am also curious what each line or verse means specifically and not just the whole song.

2. I enjoy having my own interpretations to song lyrics. It would be nice if there was a place where I could share my interpretations of lyrics and see perspectives from other listeners as well.
